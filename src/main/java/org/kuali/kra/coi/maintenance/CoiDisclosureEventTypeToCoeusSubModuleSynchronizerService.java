     * method runs, then the corresponding coeus submodule code entry (i.e. the one matching 
     * the event type code) will be deleted. If a pre-existing active disclosure event type's
     * description is changed, then the corresponding coeus submodule code entry's description 
     * will also be updated accordingly. Finally if a new active disclosure event type is added
     * then a new corresponding coeus submodule code entry will be inserted.
