--Important:

--This script will do the following:
  --1) Cleans up all junk entries in our DB tables that could be migrated.

-- This is necessary because some of our tables do not have fk constraints.  So some of our tables are referencing
-- old person id that no longer exist.  Maybe we should use fk constraints :-)

--Any errors detected during data transformation will generate a message within the dbms.

--Enjoy :-)
