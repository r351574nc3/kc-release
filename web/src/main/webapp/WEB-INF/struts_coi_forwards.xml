<!--
	This contains the forwards for Protocol.
	This fragment is included in the struts-config.xml file so that the protocol
	forwards within different actions do not have to be duplicated.
	
	This duplication occurs as a result of our "repackaging by unit-of-work" effort.  Since
	I couldn't find a struts solution for this problem, this is what I came up with :-)
